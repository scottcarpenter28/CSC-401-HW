# CSC 401 HW
These are the homework assignments that we did during class.
Assignment 1 we wrote in Lisp. The only way that we had to record our code was by using a text document.
Assignment 2 was using prolog. Prolog and lisp were big challenges to us sense these languages are unlike anything we have seen. 
Assignment 3 used python. I enjoyed programing in python and challenged myself to maximize each line of code that I wrote.
